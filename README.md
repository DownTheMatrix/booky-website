Booky is a website that allows web developers and designers to easily access hundreds of different creative resources (ready-made illustrations, vectors, icons, etc.) and use them into their projects.

### Code Dependencies

No external frameworks or libraries were harmed during the development of this website. The website was made by purely relying on the power of the CSS Grid and Flexbox layout systems, plus some simple Vanilla JavaScript to implement some basic interactivity (navigation links, display of images depending on which button was clicked, and so on).

#### Artworks

I made all the illustrations present on the site. Obviously, I drew inspirations from existing models found on the web or, in some cases, realized after watching tutorials. However, I'm responsible for the final composition and arrangement. 
Same goes for the UI, the flat landscape and the icon set present in the "Grow your ideas" section, two of which are part of my [Daily UI](https://www.dailyui.co/) challenges commitment.
Finally, I used [Figma](https://www.figma.com) as my main illustration and design tool for this project. 

##### License

+ Add "fade-in" animations to certain elements on the page, namely the illustrations
+ Create different pages, such as a 404 error page and a page for when the user clicks on the "subscribe" button
+ Add backward compatibility support (@support queries) for old browsers
